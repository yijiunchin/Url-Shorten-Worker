This is a link shortener deployed on Cloudflare Worker, allowing easy deployment without the need for a server and enabling custom domain  binding.

Features in this branch include:

- Support for configuring parameters using Cloudflare Worker environment variables.
- Support for hierarchical permissions with the ability to set admin and guest user passwords (access paths) and restrict permissions for guest user.
- Support for different homepages for unauthorized users, guest users, and admin users.
- Support for configuring regular expression rules.
- Ability to cache and manage generated records on the web page. @crazypeace
- Ability to download all generated records and cache them locally. @crazypeace
- PWA feature support.
- Also includes improvements in other aspects.

*Some features are merged from the branch of [@crazypeace](https://github.com/crazypeace/Url-Shorten-Worker).

### Regular Expression Redirect

To enable regular expression redirect, set the environment variable `EGEX_REDIRECT` to `true`.

Regular expressions are stored in the KV `#regexRedirect` key in `json` format, like this:

```
Key = #regexRedirect
Value = {"^(example.*)": "https://www.jhw.li/$1","^gg\\.(.*)":"https://www.google.com/search?q=$1"}
```

At running, it will be converted into a dictionary, where the keys are the regular expression matching rules, and the values are the replacement rules.

This value contain two regex rules.

>**Rule A**
>
>Find: `^(example.*)`
>
>Replace: `https://jhw.li/$1`

>**Rule B**
>
>Find: `^gg\.(.*)`
>
>Replace: `https://www.google.com/search?q=$1`

The passed short link will be matched sequentially and the first matched rule will be applied.

For example, if the passed short url path is `example-apple`, the redirection result will be `https://jhw.li/example-apple`. 

If the path is `gg.apple` , will be ``https://www.google.com/search?q=apple``. And you will get a quick search.

Regex rules have higher priority than short links, so make sure the `json` format is correct and properly escaped.
